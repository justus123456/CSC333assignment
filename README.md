Linear Programming Problem Solver
Project Overview
This project solves several Linear Programming (LP) problems using Python. The goal is to optimize an objective (like maximizing profit or minimizing cost) while meeting specific constraints (like limited resources). The problems are solved using Python’s scipy library.

Objective
The main objective of the project is to demonstrate how to:

Maximize or minimize an objective (e.g., profit, cost).
Solve real-world LP problems like resource allocation, production planning, and cost minimization.

Problems Covered
1. Maximizing Profit for a Factory
2. Minimizing Cost for a Manufacturer
3. Maximizing Production with Multiple Resources
4. Maximizing Revenue from Sales
5. Resource Allocation for Two Projects
6. Production Planning for a Bakery
7. Minimizing Cost for a Transport Company
8. Maximizing Revenue from Two Products
9. Advertising Campaign Budget Allocation
10. Meal Planning for a School Cafeteria

How to Run the Code
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python libraries.
3. Run the Jupyter notebook or Python scripts to solve the problems.

Dependencies
1. Python 3.x
2. numpy
3. scipy
4. matplotlib (for graphical solutions)
5. jupyter notebook
